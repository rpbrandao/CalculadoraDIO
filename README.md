## How to Run the `.sh` File

To execute the shell script (`.sh` file) included in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Give Execute Permission (if needed):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x your_script.sh
   ```
   Replace `your_script.sh` with the actual file name.

2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   ./your_script.sh
   ```
   Or, if the script requires a specific interpreter:
   ```bash
   bash your_script.sh
   ```
   Make sure you are in the correct directory or provide the full path to the script.

> **Note:** Some scripts may require additional environment variables or dependencies. Refer to any comments at the top of the script for additional usage information.
